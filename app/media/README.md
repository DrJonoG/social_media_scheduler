# Media Module

This module handles media file processing, validation, and optimisation for social media platforms.

## Overview

The media module provides utilities for:
- **File Validation**: Ensuring uploaded media meets platform requirements
- **Format Conversion**: Converting between image/video formats as needed
- **Size Optimisation**: Resizing and compressing media for optimal performance
- **Platform Compatibility**: Adapting media to each platform's specifications

## Planned Features

### Image Processing
- **Format Support**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Resize Operations**: Automatic resizing for platform requirements
- **Quality Optimisation**: Balancing file size and visual quality
- **Aspect Ratio Handling**: Cropping and padding for platform-specific ratios

### Video Processing
- **Format Support**: MP4, MOV, AVI conversion
- **Compression**: Reducing file sizes whilst maintaining quality
- **Duration Limits**: Trimming videos to platform maximums
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Creating preview images from videos

### Platform-Specific Optimisation
- **Instagram**: Square and vertical formats, Stories dimensions
- **Pinterest**: Vertical 2:3 ratio optimisation
- **X (Twitter)**: 16:9 ratio for optimal display
- **Facebook**: Various formats with automatic selection
- **Tumblr**: High-quality image preservation

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **Currently Planned** - This module is prepared for future implementation.

The application currently handles media upload and basic validation, with platform-specific processing handled by individual platform modules. This dedicated media module will centralise and enhance these capabilities.

## Dependencies

Planned dependencies include:
- `Pillow` for image processing
- `opencv-python` for advanced image/video operations
- `ffmpeg-python` for video conversion
- `imageio` for format handling

## Integration

When implemented, this module will integrate with:
- Platform modules for format requirements
- UI components for upload progress
- Database for media metadata storage
- File system for temporary processing storage
