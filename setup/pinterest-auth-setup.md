## Prerequisites

### 1. Pinterest Developer Account
- You need a Pinterest Business account or Personal account
- Access to Pinterest Developer Platform: https://developers.pinterest.com/
- App approval from Pinterest (required for production use)

   - **App description**: "Multi-platform social media scheduling tool"
   - **App website**: Your website URL (can be localhost for development)
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:8080/pinterest_callback`

### 3. Required Pinterest Scopes
Ensure your app requests these scopes:
- `boards:read` - Read user's boards
- `boards:write` - Create and modify boards
- `pins:read` - Read user's pins
- `pins:write` - Create and modify pins
- `user_accounts:read` - Read user account information

## Environment Configuration

### 1. Update .env File
Add these Pinterest configuration variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Pinterest API Configuration
PINTEREST_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
PINTEREST_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
PINTEREST_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/pinterest_callback
PINTEREST_ACCESS_TOKEN=
PINTEREST_REFRESH_TOKEN=
```

### 2. Get Pinterest App Credentials
1. In your Pinterest app dashboard, go to "App settings"
2. Copy the **App ID** â†’ use as `PINTEREST_CLIENT_ID`
3. Copy the **App secret** â†’ use as `PINTEREST_CLIENT_SECRET`
4. Verify the **Redirect URI** matches your `.env` setting

## Authentication Setup

### 1. Run Pinterest Setup Script
```bash
python scripts/pinterest_setup.py
```

### 2. Follow the Interactive Process
The script will:
1. **Validate Configuration**: Check your Pinterest app credentials
2. **Open Browser**: Launch Pinterest OAuth2 authorization page
3. **User Authorization**: You'll authorize the app to access your Pinterest account
4. **Callback Handling**: Pinterest redirects to your callback URL with authorization code
5. **Token Exchange**: Script exchanges code for access and refresh tokens
6. **Account Discovery**: Retrieves your Pinterest account info and boards
7. **Credential Storage**: Saves tokens to database or file (based on `USE_DATABASE` setting)

### 3. Authorization Flow Details
1. **Browser Opens**: Pinterest authorization page
2. **Grant Permissions**: Click "Allow" to authorize the app
3. **Redirect**: Pinterest redirects to `http://localhost:8080/pinterest_callback?code=...`
4. **Copy URL**: Copy the complete callback URL from your browser
5. **Paste in Terminal**: The script will ask for this URL
6. **Automatic Processing**: Script handles token exchange and account setup

## Verification

### 1. Check Connection Status
After setup, verify the connection:
```bash
python -c "from app.platforms.pinterest import test_pinterest_connection; test_pinterest_connection()"
```

### 2. Expected Output
```
âœ… Pinterest connection successful
ðŸ‘¤ User: your_username
ðŸ“Œ Boards: 5 found
   - My First Board (12 pins)
   - Travel Inspiration (45 pins)
   - Recipe Ideas (23 pins)
```

### 3. Dashboard Verification
1. Run the main application: `python main.py`
2. In the dashboard sidebar, check "Platform Connections"
3. Pinterest should show: `ðŸŸ¢ Pinterest: Connected`
4. Should display: `Account: @your_username` and `Boards: X available`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "No boards found" Error
**Problem**: Pinterest API returns empty boards list
**Solutions**:
- Ensure you have at least one board created on Pinterest
- Check that your boards are public or accessible
- Verify your app has `boards:read` permission

#### 2. "Media upload failed" Error
**Problem**: Image upload to Pinterest fails
**Solutions**:
- Check image format (PNG, JPG, GIF supported)
- Ensure image file size is under Pinterest limits
- Verify your app has `pins:write` permission

#### 3. "Authentication failed" Error
**Problem**: Pinterest API returns 401 Unauthorized
**Solutions**:
- Re-run `python scripts/pinterest_setup.py`
- Check that access token hasn't expired
- Verify Pinterest app credentials in `.env`

#### 4. "Permission denied" Error
**Problem**: Pinterest API returns 403 Forbidden
**Solutions**:
- Check your Pinterest app has all required scopes
- Ensure your Pinterest app is approved for production use
- Verify your account has necessary permissions

### Debug Information

#### 1. Check Stored Credentials
```bash
# For file-based storage
cat app/secure/pinterest_token.json

# For database storage
# Check platform_accounts table for pinterest entries
```

#### 2. Test API Connection
```bash
python -c "
from app.platforms.pinterest import get_pinterest_user_info, load_pinterest_credentials
creds = load_pinterest_credentials()
if creds:
    info = get_pinterest_user_info(creds['access_token'])
    print(f'User: {info}')
else:
    print('No credentials found')
"
```

#### 3. Manual Token Refresh
If tokens expire, the app will automatically attempt to refresh them using the refresh token.

## Security Notes

### 1. Token Storage
- Access tokens are stored securely (encrypted file or database)
- Refresh tokens allow automatic token renewal
- Tokens are never logged or displayed in plain text

### 2. Scope Limitations
- App only requests minimum necessary permissions
- No access to private boards unless explicitly granted
- Cannot perform actions outside granted scopes

### 3. Data Privacy
- App only accesses Pinterest data needed for posting
- No data is shared with third parties
- User can revoke access anytime through Pinterest settings

## Next Steps

After successful Pinterest setup:

1. **Test Posting**: Create a test post with an image to verify functionality
2. **Multi-Platform**: Combine Pinterest with Facebook and Instagram for comprehensive posting
3. **Content Strategy**: Optimise content for Pinterest's visual format
4. **Board Organization**: Consider creating dedicated boards for scheduled content
